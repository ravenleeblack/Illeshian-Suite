# Illeshian Suite
The Illeshian Suite is a collection of tools designed to streamline and enhance the compilation process for the Illeshian programming language. Tailored for procedural programming, the suite offers a fast, powerful, and user-friendly environment with innovative features like a two-tier function system, advanced scoping mechanisms, and a state-machine-based data toolset. By integrating the Illeshian Driver, Illeshian Runtime Processor, Illehsian Compiler, and Seedling Assembler, the suite delivers efficient native code through a unique, one-to-one compilation and assembly process that enhances code clarity and execution speed.

The Illeshian Suite is easy to learn, introduces new keywords, and leverages a redesigned scoping and assembly structure to simplify development while maintaining high performance. Its modular design ensures seamless collaboration between programs, making it an ideal choice for developers seeking both accessibility and power.

### The Illeshian Suite Modules
- **[Illeshian Driver](https://github.com/ravenleeblack/Illeshian_Driver)**: Manages the compilation workflow and coordinates the Illeshain suite modules.
- **[Illeshian Runtime Processor](https://github.com/ravenleeblack/IRP)**: Manages runtime execution by preprocessing and optimizing.
- **[Illeshian Compiler](https://github.com/ravenleeblack/Illeshian)**: Translates Illeshian source code into Seedling source code.
- **[Seedling Assembler](https://github.com/ravenleeblack/Seedling)**: Converts Seedling source code into either nasm or assembles into binary as output.
- **[Scope Table](https://github.com/ravenleeblack/Scope_Table)**: A collision-free symbol table library for Illeshian and Seedling scoping.
- **[Syntax Formatters](https://github.com/ravenleeblack/Syntax_Formatters)**: VS Code extensions for syntax highlighting of .ill and .seed files.
  

This repository serves as the central hub for the Illeshian Suite. Each module is actively developed in its own repository, linked above. Explore the suite, try it out, and feel free to contribute or share feedback to help shape the future of Illeshian!
